    "\n",
    "2. **Model complexity**: What additional information does the spaCy model provide compared to simple splitting? How might this be useful for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Trade-offs**: The spaCy approach is more computationally expensive than simple splitting. When might the extra computational cost be worth it? When might it not be?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scale considerations**: We processed a small corpus quickly. What challenges might arise when processing millions of documents? How would you approach that?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Critical thinking**: The model assigns part-of-speech tags and other linguistic features. How confident should we be in these assignments? What kinds of errors might the model make?\n",

    "\n",
    "- Try tokenizing text in a different language or domain (tweets, legal documents, poetry). How do the challenges change?\n",
    "- Compare the output of different spaCy models (small vs. large). What differences do you notice?\n",

# Welcome {.unnumbered}

Welcome to **Methods in Humanities Analytics**, a course designed for upper-level undergraduate and graduate students interested in computational approaches to analyzing texts. This course emphasizes **computational reasoning** and **flexible, adaptable research tools** over rote programming or mathematical formulas.

## Course Philosophy

### Python as a Research Tool

This course uses **Python in Google Colab** as the primary computing environment. This approach serves two audiences:

**For students with coding experience:**

- Build on your introductory Python knowledge
- Learn specialized packages for text analysis
- Adapt code examples for your own research projects
- Develop custom analytical workflows

**For students without coding experience:**

- Simply **run each code cell** to generate results
- Focus on interpreting output and understanding concepts
- Export tables and visualizations to Google Sheets or Drive  
- Use computational tools without being limited by pre-built interfaces

::: {.callout-important}
## The Goal
The goal is not to make you expert programmers. The goal is to give you **access to flexible analytical tools** that you can use to explore questions you find compelling, without being constrained by someone else's user interface.
:::

### Computational Reasoning > Code Memorization

You don't need to understand every line of code or every mathematical formula. What matters is:

- **Understanding what methods do** (conceptually)
- **Knowing when to use them** (methodologically)
- **Interpreting results critically** (analytically)
- **Making informed choices** about approaches

## How This Site Works

This documentation is organized into distinct sections, each serving a different purpose:

### 📚 Tutorials (Read & Learn)

Comprehensive, conceptual explanations of text analysis methods. These are **readable documentation** with code examples you can reference, but not interactive notebooks. They cover:

- **Foundations:** Basic concepts like sentiment analysis, corpus processing, and pipelines
- **Core Methods:** Frequency analysis, keyness, collocations, time series
- **Advanced Analysis:** Categorical variables, clustering, correlations, multidimensional analysis, vector models
- **Applications:** Real-world case studies like the Federalist Papers classification

### 🔬 Hands-On Labs (Do & Experiment)

Interactive Jupyter notebooks designed to run in **Google Colab**. Each lab:

- Opens directly in Colab with one click
- Includes all necessary setup and data loading
- Guides you through practical analytical tasks
- Can be adapted for your own projects

See the [Hands-On Labs](#hands-on-labs) section for the complete list with "Open in Colab" buttons.

### 📦 Course Resources

Documentation for the specialized Python packages used throughout the course, plus guides for accessing course datasets. No need to read this upfront—refer to it as needed.

## Getting Started

### What You Need

**Required:**

- A Google account (for Colab access)
- An internet connection
- A curious mind and interesting research questions

**Not Required:**

- Python installation on your computer
- Prior programming experience
- Advanced mathematics background
- Expensive software or computing resources

### Your First Steps

1. **Browse the Tutorials** to understand conceptual foundations
2. **Open Lab 1 in Colab** to see how the environment works
3. **Run all cells** (Runtime → Run all) to see the full analysis
4. **Explore the output** and try modifying a parameter
5. **Save a copy** to your Google Drive for future reference

::: {.callout-tip}
## Learning by Doing
Don't try to understand everything at once. Run the code, look at the results, and gradually build understanding through repeated exposure. Computational literacy develops over time.
:::

## Course Structure

### Progression Through Topics

The course follows a carefully designed progression:

1. **Start with the familiar** (sentiment in narratives)
2. **Build fundamental skills** (tokenization, frequencies)
3. **Add statistical methods** (keyness, distributions)
4. **Introduce advanced techniques** (clustering, dimensions, vectors)
5. **Apply to real problems** (classification, genre analysis)

### Tutorial + Lab Pairs

Most topics have both:

- A **tutorial** explaining concepts and theory
- A **mini lab** providing hands-on practice

Read the tutorial to understand *why* and *how*, then do the lab to see it in action.

## Python Packages for This Course

We use specialized packages designed for humanities text analysis:

### Primary Packages

- **[docuscospacy](https://docuscospacy.readthedocs.org)** - Rhetorical and functional tagging using DocuScope
- **[pybiber](https://browndw.github.io/pybiber)** - Multi-dimensional analysis of text registers
- **[moodswing](https://browndw.github.io/moodswing)** - Sentiment trajectory analysis for narratives
- **[google_ngrams](https://github.com/browndw/google_ngrams)** - Diachronic analysis with Google Books data

### Supporting Libraries

- **spaCy** - NLP processing (POS tagging, parsing, NER)
- **Polars** - Fast data manipulation (alternative to pandas)
- **matplotlib** - Visualization and plotting
- **great_tables** - Publication-ready table formatting

See [Python Packages](#python-packages-for-this-course) for detailed documentation.

## About the Data

All course data is hosted in this repository and accessible via direct URLs—no downloads required. Datasets include:

- Sample corpora (MICUSP, Brown, inaugural addresses)
- Classic literary texts (Pride and Prejudice, Madame Bovary, etc.)
- Pre-processed word lists and frequency tables
- Metadata for register and genre analysis

See [Course Data Resources](#course-data-resources) for the complete catalog.

## Computational Ethics & Critical Thinking

::: {.callout-warning}
## Methods are Tools, Not Truth
Every computational method makes assumptions, has limitations, and can be misused. Throughout this course, we emphasize:

- **Critical interpretation** - Question your results
- **Method transparency** - Document your choices
- **Reproducibility** - Share your code and data
- **Ethical awareness** - Consider impacts and biases
:::

Computational text analysis is powerful, but it's not magic. It augments human interpretation; it doesn't replace it.

## Getting Help

When you're stuck or confused:

1. **Read the error message** - Often tells you exactly what's wrong
2. **Check the tutorials** - Conceptual background and examples
3. **Review the relevant lab** - See working code in action
4. **Consult package docs** - Detailed API references
5. **Ask questions** - Use course discussion boards or office hours
6. **Search online** - Stack Overflow, documentation, forums

::: {.callout-note}
## A Note on AI Assistants
Tools like ChatGPT can help explain concepts or debug code, but:

- They sometimes provide incorrect information
- They can't replace understanding of methods
- Copy-pasting without comprehension is a missed learning opportunity
- Understanding *why* code works matters for adapting it to your needs
:::

## Acknowledgments

This course and these materials build on decades of research in:

- Corpus linguistics (Biber, Conrad, Reppen, Gries, and many others)
- Digital humanities (Jockers, Moretti, Underwood, Rhody, and many others)  
- Computational linguistics (Jurafsky, Manning, Bird, and many others)
- Rhetoric and composition (Kaufer, Ishizaki, Geisler, and many others)

The Python packages were developed with support from Carnegie Mellon University and the broader open-source community.

## Let's Begin

Ready to start? Head to the [Foundations](#foundations) section to begin with sentiment analysis, or jump directly to [Hands-On Labs](#hands-on-labs) to start experimenting in Colab.

Remember: **You don't need to be a programmer to do computational text analysis.** You just need curiosity, patience, and a willingness to experiment.
